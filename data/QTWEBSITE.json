A simple way like docmarks will be appreciated I think by all the developer community members.","comments":[{"id":"164470","text":"Link to the devnet topic :\nhttp://developer.qt.nokia.com/forums/viewthread/10063/#57249","commentDoneBy":{"username":"user_QTWEBSITE","email":"dummyEmail"},"created_at":1316973365000,"modified_at":0},{"id":"164478","text":"Old issue can be found at QTWEBSITE-126.","commentDoneBy":{"username":"user_QTWEBSITE","email":"dummyEmail"},"created_at":1317015494000,"modified_at":0},{"id":"164492","text":"Out of curiosity, when you say \"like the Docmark actually working\" - does that mean you have problems using the docmark feature as it is today?","commentDoneBy":{"username":"user_QTWEBSITE","email":"dummyEmail"},"created_at":1317023173000,"modified_at":0},{"id":"164493","text":"Sorry ;) \"like Docmark working perfectly that I am using extensively with good results\" I meant.","commentDoneBy":{"username":"user_QTWEBSITE","email":"dummyEmail"},"created_at":1317023310000,"modified_at":0},{"id":"164496","text":"Great thanks :)  \n\n@Volker: Thanks, linked the issues so we won\u0027t forget.","commentDoneBy":{"username":"user_QTWEBSITE","email":"dummyEmail"},"created_at":1317023915000,"modified_at":0},{"id":"317311","text":"I am closing this, we have a new forum.qt.io now.","commentDoneBy":{"username":"user_QTWEBSITE","email":"dummyEmail"},"created_at":1461313224000,"modified_at":0}],"created_at":1316964307000,"modified_at":1461313224000,"priority":4,"requirement_type":"issue","status":"completed","children":[],"requirementParts":[{"id":"QTWEBSITE-287_STATUS","name":"Status","text":"Closed","created_at":1557504431253},{"id":"QTWEBSITE-287_RESOLUTION","name":"Resolution","text":"Out of scope","created_at":1557504431253},{"id":"QTWEBSITE-287_ENVIRONMENT","name":"Environment","text":"\"The Qt developer network forums.\"","created_at":0},{"id":"QTWEBSITE-287_LABELS","name":"Labels","text":"[\"devnet\",\"docnotes\",\"forum\",\"forum-marker\",\"mark\"]","created_at":0},{"id":"QTWEBSITE-287_VERSIONS","name":"Versions","created_at":0},{"id":"QTWEBSITE-287_PLATFORMS","name":"Platforms","created_at":0},{"id":"QTWEBSITE-287_FIXVERSION","name":"FixVersion","text":"No FixVersion","created_at":0},{"id":"QTWEBSITE-287_COMPONENTS","name":"Components","text":"[\"qt-project.org\"]","created_at":0}]},{"id":"QTWEBSITE-288","name":"Rendering issues on Qt Devnet","text":"Since a few days, there are severe rendering issues with Qt Devnet on my installation.

There\u0027s several versions of different doc sets but it doesn\u0027t clearly mark what are the preferred doc sets users should read. This clutters the page and confuses the reader.It would be good to clearly mark the latest reference docs for e.g. Qt and Qt Mobility so that users pick the latest docs instead of older from this page.Regarding Qt 4.7 docs it\u0027s very unfortunate and error prone that Qt 4.7 goes to rather old Qt 4.7.0 docs. For mobile developers they should always use 4.7.3 or 4.7.4 docs rather than this. These have several improvements for Mobile developers as 4.7.3 and 4.7.4 are the ones that are being shipped in Nokia devices. 4.7.0 was not being shipped to Nokia devices. It is not understandable that \"Latest Qt 4.7 snapshot\" is the one that users should pick esp. \"Qt 4.7\" is listed before that. It would be good to bold of otherwise highlight the docs that most probable users should be using for Nokia devices at the moment thats the link \"Latest Qt 4.7 snapshot\" but the term \"snapshot\" might sound something preliminary.It would be good to remove the old Qt reference docs to another page called \"Documentation archive\". This would allow to clean and simplify the main page.On the Add-On side there\u0027s outdated and unnecessary material:- Teambuilder: is this anymore even a supported product?- Qt Solutions: there\u0027s two links to a same page that simply have links to Qt Mobility and Qt Quick Componetns. These links are unndessary from main doc page as the reference docs for Mobility and Qt Quick Components should be directly available. Also the \"Qt Solutions\" themselves are already archived features.- Qt for Maemo: Should link to MeeGo 1.2 Harmattan docs instead as of now.Also in the bottom of the page there\u0027s old material for unsupported things:- Qt Extended- JambiIt would be good to move these to a doc archive page too.","comments":[{"id":"169266","text":"This was automatically assigned to David Boddie but heard that David may not be actually present anymore for this work.","commentDoneBy":{"username":"user_QTWEBSITE","email":"dummyEmail"},"created_at":1322811934000,"modified_at":0},{"id":"177224","text":"doc.qt.nokia.com is not a supported website anymore.

What it happens in practice is that someone like me must go after them to their mailboxes, blogs, tweets, etc - without a clear record of whatever discussions we might have.I subscribe totally to the principle of less lists with high traffic and the education on e.g. mail filters. I think it works well to prevent the fragmentation of discussions inside a meta-area (e.g. software development) but I don\u0027t think it is the solution for everything especially when you are mixing busy people with very different backgrounds.The existence of \"marketing\" or \"community\" specific mailing lists in big free software projects is quite usual.

Also, not that I\u0027m only hosting content, the URLs in the doc are mostly the responsibility of the module maintainers. I can edit them, but I have to be aware of the issue first (file a bug). Only qt-project.org has the backend capable of doing redirects at the server level...redirecting using HTML is not ideal.\n\nI don\u0027t think we want HTML redirects at all. And as you rightly say, this has very little to do with the docs content itself; we want to set up the _infrastructure_, so that doc links \"do the right thing\" and always point at the most relevant content. We want to remove confusion for the end user, getting results on different domains depending on the search, and almost never getting the results he\u0027s really looking for (doc page in the latest Qt version).","commentDoneBy":{"username":"user_QTWEBSITE","email":"dummyEmail"},"created_at":1361193132000,"modified_at":0},{"id":"195476","text":"The thing is, I only took over these tasks 18 days ago and I\u0027m just gathering data about what we can do in the near future at the moment.

Any old \u0027stable\u0027 or \u0027qt\u0027 symbolic link should probably simply redirect to the current Qt 4.8 documentation since that\u0027s the most up-to-date version that still has the same directory structure. Also, that will closely match the intention of any 3rd party link to such a URL since they would have to date back to Qt 4 times.\n\nAnd I fully agree with Guiseppe. The idea that no proper redirects could be set up is somewhat baffling.\n\nIt is very important to keep those links working, for one because Google will for a long time still return those URLs (but you solved that by simply breaking them and waiting for them to disappear...) and the other reason is that there are years of history out there on the web that will still be referring to those, much of that on Qt community forums and StackOverflow, links that will rarely be updated but are now needlessly useless.\n\nEdit: Btw, I think part of the result of simply breaking the old redirects and excluding the snapshots from search via robots.txt is that generally no useful Google result shows up for _any_ QML item. It will basically always have harmattan-dev.nokia.com as the first result, and doc-snapshot.qt-project.org as second with the notice \"A description for this result is not available because of this site\u0027s robots.txt\", while the actual Qt 4.8 or 5.0 docs are nowhere to be seen.

Event:There are two links that display in the login box to the right of most pages on qt-project.org.  I attempted to click on the lower link where it says\"Not registered?What are you waiting for? Just register and start collecting points. It\u0027s fun!\"Clicking the word \"register\" loads the registration form in a separate page.  This registration form did not work for me but gave the following error message:\"The form you submitted contained the following errorsYou must submit the word that appears in the image\"As no captcha had been displayed, I was perplexed.  I eventually opened the Web Dev Console in Firefox and found the GET request for the recaptcha.net site (https://api-secure.recaptcha.net/challenge?k\u003d6LcbOM4SAAAAAL_DAiy3oQJd0qXuiBSac3ec22Re)When I typed this into the address bar of Firefox, I got the standard \"This Connection is Untrusted/Get Me Out Of Here\" Firefox message about not being able to verify security from recaptcha.net (since it\u0027s https), along with the following \"Technical Details\":\"api-secure.recaptcha.net uses an invalid security certificate.The certificate is only valid for www.google.com(Error code: ssl_error_bad_cert_domain)\"However, returning to the previous page, I found the upper registration link in the same box where it says \"Register Here!\"  This opened the registration form in a floating page over top of the one I was on and displayed the Captcha image correctly.  The URL for this GET request to recaptcha.net was different (http://api.recaptcha.net/js/recaptcha_ajax.js?_\u003d1363065531387) and did not require Firefox to verify a secure connection.Adding a security exception was necessary to get the Captcha to display properly on the independent page found through the lower link.  Otherwise, before investigating the GET requests in the Web Dev Console, this simply failed quietly in the background and led to several failed registration attempts and much frustration on my part.

Develop for Symbian, Maemo and Qt Simulator.","comments":[{"id":"131617","text":"There is now a rather large note below the Nokia Qt SDK download button stating:\n*Complete SDK for Qt for Symbian and Maemo*\n*Works on Windows, Linux and Mac*\n\nHopefully that will help with finding the right SDK.\n\nThanks for your feedback.","commentDoneBy":{"username":"user_QTWEBSITE","email":"dummyEmail"},"created_at":1288878405000,"modified_at":0}],"created_at":1285922588000,"modified_at":1348126686000,"priority":7,"requirement_type":"issue","status":"completed","children":[],"requirementParts":[{"id":"QTWEBSITE-90_STATUS","name":"Status","text":"Closed","created_at":1557504431238},{"id":"QTWEBSITE-90_RESOLUTION","name":"Resolution","text":"Done","created_at":1557504431238},{"id":"QTWEBSITE-90_ENVIRONMENT","name":"Environment","created_at":0},{"id":"QTWEBSITE-90_LABELS","name":"Labels","text":"[]","created_at":0},{"id":"QTWEBSITE-90_VERSIONS","name":"Versions","created_at":0},{"id":"QTWEBSITE-90_PLATFORMS","name":"Platforms","created_at":0},{"id":"QTWEBSITE-90_FIXVERSION","name":"FixVersion","text":"No FixVersion","created_at":0},{"id":"QTWEBSITE-90_COMPONENTS","name":"Components","created_at":0}]},{"id":"QTWEBSITE-91","name":"Syntax highlight has no scrollbar for a long string","text":"Input: There is a long line wrapped into syntax highlight and that has to be scrollable.Result: No scrollbar.
